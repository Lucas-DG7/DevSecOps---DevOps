# DevSecOps - DevOps

# The Challenge of the "Hackers do Bem" Course with CI/CD Pipelines

In the tech world, where automation and efficiency are essential for progress, ethical hackers face the challenge of creating CI/CD pipelines, fundamental tools for agile and secure software development. With the support of institutions like SOFTEX, Senai São Paulo, RNP, Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, and the Federal Government, the opportunity to learn and overcome barriers becomes more accessible to many students and professionals.

During the specialization in DevSecOps / DevOps offered by Hackers Do Bem, I accepted the challenge of configuring a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The course team provided a VM configured with 10 hours for students to use in the final activity, a crucial case study for completing the course. However, I decided to go beyond convenience and did not use any of the VM hours.

The reason? I wanted to test my own limits and build the entire process from scratch, configuring everything on my own Ubuntu VM directly on my notebook. This decision led me to face a series of technical difficulties and unexpected challenges but also valuable learning opportunities. Days and nights were spent adjusting codes, trying and failing, but always with the focus on achieving the coveted green build on GitHub Actions.

Throughout this journey, professors César Henrique de Oliveira and José Roberto Dantas were my inspirations and sources of support. Their guidance and patience throughout the course helped me overcome moments of frustration and understand the true importance of resilience in the tech world.

After much effort and perseverance, I finally achieved the green build – not just a technical success but a true personal achievement. The complete configuration of the CI/CD pipeline on my own machine, without resorting to the VM provided by the course, was proof that with dedication, focus, and the right support, it is possible to master the DevOps and DevSecOps universe. This victory, which goes far beyond a simple activity result, represents the overcoming of challenges and the realization of transformative learning.
